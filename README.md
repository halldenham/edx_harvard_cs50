# HarvardX: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science

These are my files from the edX class "HarvardX: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science"
I started this class in May of 2016

Copied below is the Sylabus

### Syllabus

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience.
